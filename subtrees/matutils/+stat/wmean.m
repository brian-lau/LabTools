function y = wmean(x,w,dim)
%WMEAN   Weighted Average or mean value.
%   For vectors, WMEAN(X,W) is the weighted mean value of the elements in X
%   using non-negative weights W. For matrices, WMEAN(X,W) is a row vector 
%   containing the weighted mean value of each column.  For N-D arrays, 
%   WMEAN(X,W) is the weighted mean value of the elements along the first 
%   non-singleton dimension of X.
%
%   Each element of X requires a corresponding weight, and hence the size 
%   of W must match that of X.
%
%   WMEAN(X,W,DIM) takes the weighted mean along the dimension DIM of X. 
%
%   Class support for inputs X and W:
%      float: double, single
%
%   Example:
%       x = rand(5,2);
%       w = rand(5,2);
%       wmean(x,w)
